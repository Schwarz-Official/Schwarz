### Setting Up the Project

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   1. Navigate to the [Schwarz GitHub repository](https://github.com/Schwarz-Official/Schwarz).
   2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository's page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   1. Open your forked repository on GitHub (it should be at `https://github.com/your-username/Schwarz`).
   2. Click the "Code" button and copy the URL of your forked repository.
   3. On your local machine, open your terminal or command prompt.
   4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
   5. Run the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/schwarz-repo.git
      ```

3. **Set Up Remote Upstream**:
   1. Change your directory to the cloned repository:
      ```bash
      cd Schwarz
      ```

   2. Add the original Schwarz repository as a remote named "upstream" to stay synced with the latest changes:
      ```bash
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/Schwarz-Official/Schwarz.git
      ```

7. **Install Dependencies**: Schwarz has both frontend (React) and backend (Django) components. First, install the required packages in both the `frontend` and `backend` folders:
   ```bash
   # Inside the frontend folder
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Inside the backend folder
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

#### Frontend (React App)

To run the React app, navigate to the `frontend` folder and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will start the React development server. You can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Backend (Django Server)

To run the Django backend, navigate to the `backend` folder and apply migrations, create a superuser, and then run the server:

```bash
cd backend

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run the server
python manage.py runserver
```

The Django server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
