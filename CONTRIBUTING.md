# Schwarz Hacktoberfest 2023

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Schwarz! To get started, please follow these steps to prepare your GitHub repository for contributing:

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Schwarz GitHub repository](https://github.com/Schwarz-Official/Schwarz).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository's page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

1. Open your forked repository on GitHub (it should be at `https://github.com/your-username/Schwarz`).
2. Click the "Code" button and copy the URL of your forked repository.
3. On your local machine, open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
5. Run the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/schwarz-repo.git
   ```

## Step 3: Configure Upstream

1. Change your directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd Schwarz
   ```

2. Add the original Schwarz repository as a remote named "upstream" to stay synced with the latest changes:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Schwarz-Official/Schwarz.git
   ```

## Step 4: Create a New Branch

1. Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contributions. This helps keep your work isolated:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Replace `my-feature` with a descriptive name for your feature or bug fix.

## Step 5: Make Changes and Commit

1. Make the necessary changes to the code, documentation, or other project files.
2. Use the following commands to stage and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

   Replace `"Description of your changes"` with a brief, meaningful description of your contributions.

## Step 6: Push Your Changes

1. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

   Replace `my-feature` with the name of your branch.

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "New Pull Request" button.
3. Set the base repository to `Schwarz-Official/Schwarz` and the base branch to the branch you want to merge into.
4. Set the head repository to your forked repository and the compare branch to your feature branch (`my-feature`).
5. Click "Create Pull Request" and fill in a descriptive title and comment explaining your changes.

That's it! You've prepared your GitHub repository and are ready to start contributing to Schwarz for Hacktoberfest 2023. Our team will review your pull request, and if everything looks good, your changes will be merged into the project.
