# Welcome to the Schwarz Community!

## Our Promise

At Schwarz, we're a friendly bunch! We promise to make everyone feel welcome, no matter who you are. It doesn't matter if you're new to coding or a seasoned pro, young or old, from anywhere in the world, we're happy to have you here. Our aim is to keep things respectful and fun for everyone.

## What We Expect

To keep things running smoothly and happily, we'd like everyone to follow these simple rules:

1. **Be Friendly:** Just like in real life, a friendly attitude goes a long way here. Let's all be nice to each other and respect our differences.

2. **Act Like a Pro:** We're all here to learn and grow. Please keep your language and behavior professional. Let's avoid anything that could hurt or offend someone.

3. **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:** We're a team! Collaboration is key. Let's work together, support each other, and remember that we're all on the same team.

4. **Feedback is Golden:** Feedback helps us improve. Share your thoughts constructively. Keep the focus on the work, not the person.

5. **Respect Always:** Discrimination, mean comments, or personal attacks have no place here. Let's treat everyone with respect.

6. **Privacy Matters:** Respect each other's privacy. Don't share personal info without permission.

## Reporting Concerns

If you see someone not playing nice, don't hesitate to let us know. We're here to help. You can reach out to schwarzstudios@gmail.com. We'll keep things confidential, and we promise to take it seriously.

## What Happens If You Break the Rules

We're a friendly bunch, but we take our code of conduct seriously. If someone doesn't follow the rules, we might give them a friendly warning, or, in extreme cases, they might need a little time off. We'll always be fair and respectful.
